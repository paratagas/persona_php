App for keeping stats of border crossing

This app was created in Novaember 2014. This is a software written using PHP and MySQL
for keeping stats of border crossing for government agencies. It has a russian language
interface, and I am not planning to internalizate it.

Installing:
  - launch create_db_tables.sql (this will create MySQL DB and tables)

Login: admin

Password: 111

Requirements: PHP 5.3+

App also has documentation in apidoc folder, created by PHPDocumentor

Internal project documentation written in Russian and because the project is
old I am not planning to translate it.
